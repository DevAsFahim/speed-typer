                <p class="blog_text mt-4">The HTTP protocol is one of the most important protocols for smooth communication between the server and the client. The main disadvantage of the HTTP protocol it is a stateless protocol that means it does not track any kind of information of response and request by the server and the client, So in order to resolve this problem, there are three ways to track useful information In this article we are going to see the difference between Local Storage and Session Storage. <br>
                
                    <strong>Local Storage: </strong>This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session). <br>
                    <strong>Session Storage: </strong> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                <p class="blog_text mt-4">JavaScript is pretty renowned in the current programming market, and that is due to its vast usage. Becoming a JavaScript developer is not only a good job but it is now essential to survive in the programming market. Javascript, just like any other programming language, depends on the use of variables. And each variable has its own scope. <br>
                    <strong>Global Scope</strong>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope</strong>Block scope is a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
